                <h3>3. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
                <p>As independent operators, we have a simple approach to data sharing:</p>
                
                <h4>Public Information</h4>
                <p>When you post reviews or comments, your Discord username and avatar are displayed publicly alongside your content. This is necessary for community functionality.</p>

                <h4>No Commercial Sharing</h4>
                <p>We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information to anyone.</p>

                <h4>Legal Requirements</h4>
                <p>We may disclose information if required by law or to protect the safety of our users and the integrity of the Service.</p>

                <h4>Service Functionality</h4>
                <p>Basic technical information may be shared with hosting providers and essential service providers, but only as necessary for website functionality.</p>

                <h3>4. Data Storage and Security</h3>
                <p>As a small group of developers, we implement reasonable security measures within our capabilities to protect your information. However, we cannot guarantee absolute security, and you use the Service understanding this limitation.</p>

                <h3>5. Data Retention</h3>
                <p>We retain your information only as long as necessary to provide the Service. You may request deletion of your account and associated data by contacting us. Note that some content (like reviews) may remain in anonymized form for community continuity.</p>

                <h3>6. Your Rights and Choices</h3>
                <p>You have the following rights regarding your information:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Access:</strong> Ask us what information we have about you</li>
                    <li><strong>Correction:</strong> Request correction of inaccurate information</li>
                    <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Request deletion of your account and data</li>
                    <li><strong>Withdrawal:</strong> Stop using the Service at any time</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <strong>Easy Data Control:</strong> Since we're a small operation, you can contact us directly for any data-related requests. We'll respond as quickly as possible.
                </div>

                <h3>7. Cookies and Tracking</h3>
                <p>We use minimal cookies necessary for the Service to function (like keeping you logged in). We do not use tracking cookies or analytics that follow you across the internet.</p>

                <h3>8. Third-Party Services</h3>
                <p>Our Service integrates with Discord for authentication. Discord's own Privacy Policy governs your use of Discord's services. We may also link to other websites, but we're not responsible for their privacy practices.</p>

                <h3>9. Age Requirements</h3>
                <p>Our Service is intended for users who meet Discord's age requirements. We do not knowingly collect information from users under the age of 13.</p>

                <h3>10. International Users</h3>
                <p>As independent developers, we operate this Service internationally. Your information may be processed in different countries, but we maintain the same privacy standards regardless of location.</p>

                <h3>11. Changes to Privacy Policy</h3>
                <p>We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. We'll post any changes on this page and update the "Last Updated" date. Significant changes will be communicated through the Service.</p>

                <h3>12. Discord's Privacy Policy</h3>
                <p>Your use of Discord's authentication services is also governed by Discord's Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review Discord's privacy practices as well.</p>
